# Streamlit deployment package

This folder contains a minimal Streamlit app (`app.py`) and `fashion_cnn_state.pth` (your model file).

Steps to deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the contents of this folder (app.py, requirements.txt, fashion_cnn_state.pth).
2. On Streamlit Community Cloud (https://share.streamlit.io), create a new app and point it to this GitHub repo and branch. Set `app.py` as the main file.
3. The app will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run.
